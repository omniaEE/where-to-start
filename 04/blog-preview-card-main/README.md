- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM (not perfectly)

### What I learned

- variable fonts
  it was my first time hear about so I searched about and it's (in simple way ) multiple styles, weights, and widths within a single file
  I used google fonst before but I did not know that's variable font
- BEM
  which is an abrouch or way to make more organized code
